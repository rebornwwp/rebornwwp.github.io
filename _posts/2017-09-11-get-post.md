django在处理表格的时候，只是用到了http中的GET和POST方法，下面做简单的介绍


# POST

Django’s login form is returned using the POST method, in which the browser bundles up the form data, encodes it for transmission, sends it to the server, and then receives back its response.

* a request that makes changes in the database - should use POST.
* POST, coupled with other protections like Django’s CSRF protection offers more control over access.

# GET

GET, by contrast, bundles the submitted data into a string, and uses this to compose a URL. The URL contains the address where the data must be sent, as well as the data keys and values. You can see this in action if you do a search in the Django documentation, which will produce a URL of the form https://docs.djangoproject.com/search/?q=forms&release=1.

* GET should be used only for requests that do not affect the state of the system.
* GET would also be unsuitable for a password form, because the password would appear in the URL, and thus, also in browser history and server logs, all in plain text. 
* Neither(否定) would it be suitable for large quantities of data, or for binary data, such as an image.
* GET is suitable for things like a web search form
