Last month I spent such an unforgettable week with participants from all over the world in Ilmenau, Germany(2017.iswi.org) to discuss the topic 'Global Justice'. It was my first time in Europe and the first student conference I joined, the conference was a crazy party week and it was so amazing. I came there alone and surprised to find that I'm the only delegate from China!


### To Get to Ilmenau
Ilmenau was quite a small city located in central Germany, the transportation is not that convinient compared with other big cities. From Berlin, I could either take FlixBus or ICE, finally I chose to take ICE from Berlin Central Station which is 20 mins from the airport, it took about 4 hours to get to ilmenau. Pay attention that ICE has a reservation system, if you don't pay for the reservation you can still choose a seat after riding on the train, but it might be reserved, in that case you need to look for some other seat.


### General Experience
The conference was held by TU Ilmenau, an university centering in technology. The campus was built on a moutain with a very nice secenery. I actually met several computer science guys there ^_^.

A typical day during the week is basically lecture/workshop + discussion + live concert/some other festival + club night, starting from 9 am to 2pm. The lectures were actually very interesting, there were topics on international NGOs, human rights, and even Bitcoin!

I was in the music group, and I met extremly talented people there, there was a professional pianist and famous band members! We made an original EuroVision-like song about global justice. Somehow I've managed to play the electronic guitar and the closing ceremony finally ^_^.

During the live concert, I could experiece something "Germany" (mixed beer haha). Somehow I love the idea of mixing beer with everything.

After schedule on the time table finally comes party time! I'm not a night person so I only went to clubs inside campus for three times, I tasted all kinds of beer from different parts of Germany, but unluckily I missed the "JÃ¤germeister night".


### Incidents in Berlin
Unluckily my cash (about 150 euros) was stolen in the bus from the airport to Berlin central station. Before coming I thought Germany was general safe but this incident told me it's not. What disappoints me most is how the police deal with such things. In my case, the policeman said it wasn't much money at all and it happens here every day. I believe they're not making any efforts to stop theft towards travellers, even not putting on a notice telling people to take care of their wallet.

Another incident was after the conference when I spent several days to hangout with my friends in Berlin. One day I walked on the street and suddenly a middle aged man riding a bicycle passed by me calling me "stupid Chinese". I tried to grab him out of his fucking bycle but he had been already far away. Guys if you encounter similar insults in Germany, erect your middle figure and call him "Wichser".

I'm so disappointed in Berlin, the conference I joined was about "Global Justice", and in Berlin it seems not "safe" to be Asian, it's not global justice at all. There're still many ignorant people in the world, that's why global justice is so hard to achieve.

### My Thinkings
Except the disappointment in Berlin, I had nice time in Germany. I met amazing people of my age in the conference, my vision about the world was different now, I saw young people doing great effort to achieve global justice, it's not easy, let's try at least!
